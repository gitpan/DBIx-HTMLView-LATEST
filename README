Description
-----------

HTMLView is a set of modules to handle relational SQL databases
through a DBI interface and create web userinterfaces to them. Among
it's features are the possibility to handle relations in the same
manner as fields and it is easily extended with additional field or
relation specifications as well as custom editors and viewers.

HTMLView contains a query language based on SQL, but extended to allow
easy inclusion of relations in the queries. Say you have a Users
table with an N2N relation, called grp, to a Groups table you can select
users from the Users table based on the name field in the Groups
table by selecting on grp->name (eg "grp->name = 'sudo'" would match
all users belonging to the group named sudo while "grp->gid = 27" would
match all users belonging to the group with gid 27).

There is also a fmt language used to specify how the data in a post
or a set of posts should be presented. It works in a template like way
with a html like format, and it can be specified on a PostSet, Post or
Relation/Field level.

It's most frequent use is that it allows you to write a fmt file and
in it place a "<node>...</node>" construct, which will repeat the
"..." part for every post that's supposed to be viewed. It can contain 
"<fld name>" tags which will be replaced by the fld (field or relation)
named name. It's also possible to specify how that data in an fld
should be viewed by instead using the "<fmt name>...</fmt>" where
"..." is a new fmt string used to view the fld. This is especially
useful for relations as it allows you to specify exactly how the
related posts should be presented.

It's also possible to insert perl code that's executed using
"<perl>...</perl>" constructs. Se the README.fmt file for a complete
description of the language.

For a simple example se the Test2.fmt file which will work together
with the Test2 table from the set of test tabels used by test.pl. To
view the content of the entire table, try:

  Formated2.cgi?tab=Test1&fmt=Test1

This package has over the years grown quite big and quite slow. So
it's now possible to compile your fmt's into some realy fast perl
code. This code can then be compiled and placed in memroy reday to be
presented to the users. This can be done either by the Apache mod_perl
module Apache::HTMLView avalible on cpan. See it's README for a 
description on how to set that up. Or by the fmt_srv.pl which is a 
little webserver written in perl designed to present those fmts and 
some static html files as fast as possible, which means everything is
loaded into memory.

For a list of tags you can use when you write your fmt files, see
README.fmt. Some tags are only avavlible for the compiled fmts and not
for the fmt used by Formated2.cgi. These are described in
README.compiled_fmt.

Build and Install
-----------------

All you have to do to build, test and install this stuff, if your
connected to the Internet, is:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

This will run the tests on a database named HTMLViewTester in a local
mysql server which you'll have to create first, se the config.pm file
if you don't know howto.

The default tests uses a mySQL database which means that you'll need 
DBD::mySQL in order to run them. The config.pm file also contains 
instructions on how to set up a test database for mSQL, and in that
case you'll of course need DBD::msql instead. You should be able to
use this system with other database engines as well and in that case
you'll need their DBD's. 

Usage Overview 
--------------

NOTE: This section is quite out of date and as it does not describe
the compied fmts which are the sugested way to use this.

This system  is based on a central DBIx::HTMLView::DB object, $db,
that contains the definition of the database and it's tables. It is
constructed with the shortcuts in the DBIx::HTMLView package (se it's
manpage for details). This object is defined in config.pm for the test
database and then that file used by both the test.pl script and the
example cgi scripts.

Each table inside the database class is defined with a
DBIx::HTMLView::Table object $tab which you'll get hold of with
$db->tab('table name'). This object can then be used the list the
posts in that table using $tab->list. That will return a
DBIx::HTMLView::PostSet object with the posts in form of
DBIx::HTMLView::Post objects.

Post and Table object are in build up of several DBIx::HTMLView::Fld
objects describing the fields and relations. For Posts this object
contains both the structure of it and the data contained in them. In 
the case of the Table it's of course only the structure. Those Fld
objects are returned by the fld('fld name') method that is defined
both for Table and Post objects.

To then view your data there is the method view_fmt It will output
the object according to a fmt string that in a HTML like way allows you to
format your Posts or PostSets in any way you like. The fmt strings can
either be defined as a parameter to view_fmt or as a predefined format in
the table definition.

There are a few predefined formates: view_html, edit_html, view_text. That
is used to create the default ways of viewing and editing the tables, and
they can also be used as a base for a custom fmt. For info on the fmt
language se the README.fmt file.

There are two standard editors one for the entire database,
DBIx::HTMLView::CGIListView, which then calls another editor, usually
the DBIx::HTMLView::CGIReqEdit editor that's used for editing single
posts. 

All this is controlled by the View.cgi script which decides what
editors should be used and when. It also sets all the parameters to
the editors and can be used to give flds default values or make sanity 
checks on the data typed by the user.

The Formated2.cgi script is used to generate nicely formated output,
both viewers and editors, specified by a separate .fmt file. The .fmt
should contain a fmt string designed to view a PosetSet. The script has two
parameters to control this. It is tab which should be set to the table name
to use and it is fmt which should be set to the fmt file to use. The path
where fmt files are searched for is specified at the top of the cgi script.

There is three ways to specify which posts should be viewed. Both is
done through setting cgi variables. Either you set the sel to a
search string as expected by the DBIx::HTMLView::Table::list method, or 
you set flds to a coma-separated (ie ", ") list of flds and query to a 
string which should be search for in all those flds. Finely you can
leave everything empty and all posts will be displayed.

There is also the Formated.cgi script, which is mainly there for backwards
compatibility. It works just like Formated2.cgi but it wants it's fmt file
in a different (less smooth) format. It should contain three fields: HEAD, 
NODE and FOOT (se the example Test2.fmt on how to defined them). All tree of 
them is supposed to contain perl code that is executed at appropriate times. 
HEAD is executed as the first thing done, NODE once for ever matched post
with $_ set to the current DBIx::HTMLView::Post object and FOOT at the end.

Mailinglist

There is a mailing list for announcements and questions about HTMLView 
if you have any problems using it or questions about it you can mail
