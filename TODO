Use order from definition in editors/viewers
Docs
Formated editor/viewer with ->edit_html or ->view_html tied to %db
Autodetect order flds
FIXME's
Time optimisations
Security checks on read only fields
Separate public and private methods in the docs
Separate overriden methods describing only changes
Make sure posts wont get extra fields from other tables defined on related selects
Save related data from multitable select to preven futher db calls
Make $data in all Fld constructors case insensitive
Add required require statements to the synopsis
Implement some access restrictions, fld and table based, update the "this is 
         not a secure way ..." in the CGI... classes.
Let the user set the sices of the sql types in the params
Don't bug out if a field is left empthy in a html form.
Don't bug out if an empthy sel fields is pased to Fromated.cgi
Write the tutorial an update the HTMLview.pm docs
Move the QuickStart doc from the old distribution
Move default/formated editors to edit_html in Post, PostSet, update README file
Extende the Formated.cgi docs
Combine all data getting subs in the Flds to one common
Currently all Id fields are presumed to be Int types both in N2N and N2One
N2N uses $self->tab->db and defined sub db instead of using Fld::db
Add a proc to the DB class specifying the NULL string
Test the view_fld stuff
Have PostSet::posts return an tied array linked to the get_first and get_next methods.
Make it possible to chnage default named fmts of Post and PostSet (in Table), update README.fmt
Support several <node>...</node> constructs in the PostSet fmts, update docs, update README.fmt
Move all default fmt constructors to separat modules (eg html.pm, text.pm, ...)

 * Optimized fmt handling viewing an fmt with only fields are now 
   54% faster. The same optimations should be appliable for relations.
Compiled fmt with multilevel SubTab relatiosn might fail
Add tests of compiled fmts to test.pl
Get seraching working with compiled fmt containing SubTre flds
Autocreate _pre_actions from code within the fmt files form's
